# Access to Unique, Local Products
Merchants can source distinct products directly from producers, enhancing their product lineup and offering items that are not widely available in larger retail chains. This can help differentiate their offerings and attract customers looking for unique or locally-made products.                    

# Reduced Supply Chain Costs
By purchasing directly from producers, merchants can reduce costs associated with intermediaries. Lower acquisition costs can improve profit margins or allow merchants to offer more competitive pricing.                    

# Assurance of Product Quality and Origin
Merchants benefit from a clearer understanding of where and how the products are made, which can be a significant selling point for consumers increasingly interested in ethical and sustainable purchasing.
